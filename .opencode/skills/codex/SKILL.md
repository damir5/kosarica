## What I do
Provide consultation with OpenAI's Codex CLI, a lightweight coding agent that runs in your terminal, helping with code generation, debugging, and development tasks using OpenAI's frontier models.

## When to use me
Use this skill when you need OpenAI-powered coding assistance for:
- Code generation and completion

## How to consult Codex CLI
1. Install Codex CLI: `npm i -g @openai/codex`
2. Authenticate with your OpenAI account
3. Run queries: `codex "your coding task"`
4. Use interactive mode for multi-turn conversations
5. Leverage IDE integration for seamless workflow

## Examples
- `codex "build a Node.js API server"`
